Online Buying Club for Open Cart

These xml files, when combined with the "View Customer's Saved Cart" module, enable the cart to be used for a Buying Club or other group/community portal where the cart itself acts as the order, so that in the case where product prices are only approximate until shipment arrives, the orders can all be processed from the admin side, once final prices have been commited.
